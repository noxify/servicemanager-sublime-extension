# Service Manager Sublime Extension

A Sublime Text package which allows you to create and modify Service Manager ScriptLibraries outside the Service Manager Client.

# Features

* Multiple Environments
* Create a new ScriptLibrary from a local file
* Push and Pull for ScriptLibraries
* Compile
* Code Snippets with auto-complete
* (Soon) Syntax Highlighting

# Installation

* Download the Repository
* Extract the zip archive and rename it from `sublime_hpsm-master` to `sublime_hpsm` 
* Browse to your Sublime Text Packages directory (There is a menu entry in Sublime if you don't know where the packages are stored)
* Copy the `sublime_hpsm` into the `Packages` directory

Note: If you have also `Package Control` installed, please add `"remove_orphaned": true,` to your `Package Control User Settings`. Otherwise the package will be removed.

Inside the Service Manager, you have to create a new `extaccess` record.

Please ensure that the used operator has enough permissions to create/update/compile a ScriptLibrary and that the capability `RESTful API` is set in the operator.

# Code Snippets

I'm a lazy guy and I hate to repeat myself over and over again - This is the reason why I built this extension.

It allows to define unlimited code snippets as JS file.
it allows you also to define a tab completion.
With this, you can speed up yourself - Yeah!

If you want to use your own code snippets, you have to go to `Preferences > Package Settings > HPSM > Browse User Templates`.

This packages comes with the following auto-complete templates:

## hpsm-nullsub

```
system.functions.nullsub( ${0:argument}, ${1:fallback} );
```

## hpsm-scfile-basic

```
var f${0:File} 	= new SCFile( "${1:tablename}" );
var q${0:File} 	= true;
var rc${0:File} = f${0:File}.doSelect( q${0:File} );
```

## hpsm-scfile-complete

```
var f${0:File} = new SCFile( "${1:tablename}" );
var q${0:File} = true; 
var rc${0:File} = f${0:File}.doSelect( q${0:File} );

while( rc${0:File} == RC_SUCCESS ) {
	//your code 
	rc${0:File} = f${0:File}.getNext();
}
```

You can also fetch values from the settings.

```
{{Setting:Fullname}}
```

`Fullname` is the key from the settings file - You can add also new keys to the `user` config.
